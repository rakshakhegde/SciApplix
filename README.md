# SciApplix
Collection of my awesome programs

Since 9th grade I've been writing code to demo some concept, maybe related to Science, Math, or even illusions.
So here's the code for all those awesome stuff.

To run the project, you could fork this project and run the class in src/SciApplix/MainMenu which will take you to a GUI to choose a demo to run.

**Enjoy!** :grin:
